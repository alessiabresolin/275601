### 2) Introduction
What does our project consists in? We have identified ourselves into members of the data science team of a prestigious fashion firm. Our primary aim is to boost the revenues of the company using any possible legal mean. 
Our online platform does not suffer any particular issue. However, we want to improve our recommender system. In this project, we will test different systems and select the most efficient one.

### 3) Methods
We have been proposed 3 datasets containing information for: customers, transactions and articles. We have analyzed all of them through a deep explanatory data analysis. 

#### a) Data Understanding
- 'recsys_customers.csv': customer id associated to age and optional participation to fashion news and club member.
- 'recsys_articles.csv': article id associated to the name of the product, colour of the product (from very detailed to very general), department, group of membership, section or type of garment.
- 'recsys_transactions.csv': purchase done by a customer on a certain date

#### b) Data Preparation 
The output of this first step is a clean and more comprehensible dataset. This stage helps us to have a better insight of our data, especially about the relationship between customers and transactions. We have identified all the missing values and highlighted some important features of each dataset.
- Deal with Null values in 'recsys_customer';
- Create additional dataframes;
- Deal with Null Values in 'recsys_article' by removing them;

#### c) EDA
Explanatory Data Analysis is a fundamental process in Machine Learning for data preparation. It is key to understand the intrinsic features of our datasets by applying different Python packages:
- Pandas;
- Numpy;
- Sklearn;
- Matplotlib.pyplot;
- Seaborn.

**Customers** <br>
We have data for more than 40 thousands customers. For each of them, we have records of their identifier, if they are subscribed to fashion news, if they have a club membership and their age. Through EDA we have noticed that there was a small percentage of Null values (0.32%) in the age column. We decided to replace them by the value of the mode of the age of all the customers. 

We have grouped customers into age categories, calculated how many people belong to each of them and calculated the proportion of people who is subscribed to either the club membership or fashion news.

**Transactions** <br>
For transactions, we have a file that stores all the purchases made by each customers and the date in which they made it. We calculated the number of transactions per customer and the maximum value of purchaess made by a single customer is 104 transactions. To get a better insight of the dataset, we have grouped all the transactions in classes and we noticed that only a small proportion of customers has done more than 30 transactions. We finally calculated also the number of customers that has bought each product.

**Articles** <br>
6536 articles are stored in our dataset, with all their characteristics. Each product belongs to many categories: they have a garment group, a section, a deparment, an index group and a type. We use the Explanatory Data Analysis to look for the best identifier for all the products. We have decided to discard the more precise classes to avoid overfitting and also too general ones, because they may lead to an inaccurate recommender system. We finally decided to take into consideration only the articles' type and section. Furthermore, we have noticed the presence of 'Unknown' items, which we have deleted because they represented just a small proportion of the data.
Another attribute of the articles is the colour. Again, we have taken into consideration only the 'perceived_colour_master' which was, for us, the best middle way between dealing with overfitting and having a precise model.

## 4) Recommender System
Our recommender system generates a list of articles that a customer might be interested in, basing on its actual purchases and on the similarities with other users. 

##### Content filtering 
The first type of recommendation system we have applied is: content filtering recommender system. 
The final suggestions are shaped on the basis of features of the products, such as their color, their department and so on with all the other properties of the articles.

- One Hot Encoding
We create a one hot encoding for the colour value of the articles. We do the same for the section and the type of the product. We obtain 3 tables with ID of articles as rows and all the features as columns. Inside the tables, the value of a cell will be 1 if a specific article will have a specific feature. We finally concatenate all the tables.

- Cosine Similarity
To evaluate the similarity between products, we use cosine similarity, which avails of the cosine angle between two vectors. Clearly, the smaller the angle, the higher the degree of similarity. 

- Final step
We are now ready to return the 10 recommended items for the input product, identified by its ID. We have noticed that there is the possibility to receive as recommended item, the same output that the funnction gets as input. This is not a problem because a user might decide to buy again the same product. Anyway, we inserted a function that checks for this issue and in the case in happens, the recommender system will remove the input item and add the 11th item in the rank in the output. 

##### Collaborative filtering: matrix factorization
The second type of recommendation system we have applied is: user-based filtering recommender system.
This kind of system is based on the idea of considering customers' opinions on the different products and suggest an article based on other purchases of the user and purchases and opinions of customers that are similar to him. Basically, in this case, we use information collected by different customers to recommend products to the actual customer.

- CSR Matrix
We began by creating a matrix with 'customer_id' and 'article_id' in order to map how many transactions have occured in the dataset. However, the matrix will have plenty of unobserved elements because each user purchases only a small amount of products with respect to the entirety of them. We calculated the sparsity of the matrix and we noticed its value was way too small to consider it to make reliable predictions. 

- Increase sparsity
To limit this issue, we decided to consider only a part of the dataset. We discarded all the columns of the customers who bought less than a certain amount of products. Similarly, we discarded some of the rows that corresponded to the products that has been bought less.

- KNN
We imported KNN from 'sklearn' library in order to 
We have an m Ã— n matrix of transactions, with customers (id from 0 to n) and products (id from 0 to m).  

##### Collaborative filtering: neural network

## Final output
Our recommender engine has been implemented to boost the revenues of our company by predicting user preferences and recommending the right products to each user. We have applied different kinds of recommendations using content-based and collaborative filtering systems.
